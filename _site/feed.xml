Technologies such as sensor-based monitoring systems allow farmers to monitor land and crop conditions in real-time, so they can identify problems such as water shortages or pest attacks early and take necessary action quickly. With better monitoring, farmers can optimize the use of resources and ensure their crops grow in the best conditions.</p>

<p>In addition, the application of drones for fertilization and pesticide spraying is a revolutionary innovation in corn farming. The use of drones allows for a more even and efficient distribution of fertilizers and pesticides, reducing unnecessary chemical use and improving overall plant health. Drones can also reach areas that are difficult to reach with conventional tools, ensuring that all parts of the land receive the same level of care. With this technology, farmers can increase their yields without having to significantly increase production costs.</p>

<p>The use of soil moisture meters is also an important innovation in corn cultivation. This tool helps farmers to know the condition of soil moisture accurately, so they can determine the right irrigation schedule and avoid over-watering or under-watering. With better water management, corn plants can grow healthier and their productivity increases. The use of this appropriate technology not only helps farmers manage their land more efficiently but also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing excessive use of natural resources.</p>
