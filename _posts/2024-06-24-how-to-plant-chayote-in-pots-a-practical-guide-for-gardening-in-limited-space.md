Planting chayote (*Sechium edule*) in pots is an ideal solution for those who want to garden but have limited space. Chayote is a very flexible climbing plant, able to grow well even in narrow spaces such as terraces or balconies. This advantage makes it the right choice for urban dwellers who want to enjoy fresh agricultural products without requiring a large area. In addition, chayote is also known to be easy to care for, making it suitable for both novice and experienced gardeners.

This practical guide will help you grow chayote in pots with simple yet effective steps, from selecting the right seeds to the harvesting process. You will learn how to prepare the appropriate planting medium, the correct techniques for planting seeds, and how to care for plants so they grow well. By following this guide, you can enjoy a bountiful and quality harvest of chayote, even if you only have limited planting space.

##### Selecting Chayote Seeds

Chayote seeds can be obtained from ripe fruit or seeds. To start, choose a chayote that is of good quality, without defects and is old. Store the fruit in a humid place for about a week until the shoots grow about 10-20 cm or have 3-4 leaves. After the shoots grow, the seedlings are ready to be transferred to potting media.

##### Preparing Planting Media

Prepare a large pot to provide enough space for the chayote roots to grow. Mix the soil with manure, compost, and rice husk charcoal in a ratio of 2:1:1:1. This planting media mixture will provide sufficient nutrients and maintain soil moisture.

##### Planting Chayote Seeds

Once the planting media is ready, follow these steps:
1. Fill the pot with the soil mixture until it is almost full.
2. Make a planting hole in the middle of the pot.
3. Carefully plant the chayote seeds in the hole.
4. Cover the hole again with soil and compact it slightly so that the seeds stand upright.
5. Water the soil with enough water until it is moist.

##### Installing the Racks

Chayote is a climbing plant, so it needs racks or supports to support its growth. Install racks or sticks made of bamboo slats when the plant starts to grow tendrils or reaches a height of about 50-60 cm. The height of the racks can be adjusted according to needs and available space.

##### Plant Maintenance

1. **Watering:** Water the plants every day, especially in the morning and evening. Make sure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.
2. **Additional Fertilization:** Provide additional fertilizer periodically to ensure the plants get enough nutrients. You can use organic fertilizer or liquid fertilizer according to the instructions for use.
3. **Weeding:** Clean weeds that grow around the plants to prevent competition for nutrients.

##### Pruning

At the age of 3-6 weeks, prune the tips of branches and old leaves to stimulate the growth of new shoots. This pruning is important to ensure optimal shoot distribution, so that the fruit produced is of good quality.

##### Pest and Disease Control

Chayote is susceptible to attacks by armyworms and ladybugs, as well as wilt disease. To control pests, spray insecticides such as azodrin at a dose of 2cc per liter of water. Separate plants that are infected with wilt disease so that it does not spread to healthy plants.

##### Chayote Harvest

The first harvest can be done when the plant is 3-5 months old. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the chayote from the stem. After the first harvest, you can harvest every week. The productive period of chayote in a pot can reach 3-4 years, depending on the care given.

Planting chayote in a pot is a practical and effective way to garden in limited space. By following the steps above, you can enjoy an abundant and quality chayote harvest. Good luck and success in your gardening efforts!
