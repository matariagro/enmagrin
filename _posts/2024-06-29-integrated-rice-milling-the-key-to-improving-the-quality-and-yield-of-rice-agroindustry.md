Rice milling is the central point in the rice agroindustry in Indonesia. Currently, many rice mills still use simple and outdated equipment, which results in relatively low production results. To improve quality and yield, an integrated agribusiness system approach is needed. This approach not only focuses on the production of quality rice, but also involves the processing of by-products such as rice flour, vermicelli products, animal feed, and rice husk charcoal briquettes, as well as consistent quality management. With an integrated rice milling business strategy, the added value generated can range from IDR 6.4 million to IDR 16.6 million per hectare.

##### Rice Milling in Indonesia

Rice milling is an important process that determines the quality and quantity of rice produced. However, many rice mills in Indonesia still use simple and outdated technology, so that the efficiency and quality of the milling results are less than optimal. This has an impact on the low quality of the rice produced and the high level of yield loss.

##### Challenges in Traditional Rice Milling

Some of the main challenges faced by traditional rice mills include:
1. **Outdated Equipment**: Many rice mills use old and inefficient machines.
2. **Loss of Yield**: The inefficient milling process results in high levels of yield loss.
3. **Low Rice Quality**: The use of simple technology is unable to produce high-quality rice that the market wants.

##### Integrated Rice Milling Strategy

To overcome these challenges, an integrated agribusiness system approach is needed. The integrated rice milling strategy involves several key aspects as follows:

1. **Quality Rice Production**
- **Technology Improvement**: Replacing obsolete equipment with modern technology that is more efficient and capable of producing high-quality rice.
- **Workforce Training**: Providing training to rice milling workers to operate modern equipment and maintain quality standards.

2. **By-Product Processing**
- **Rice Flour**: Processing broken rice or rice that does not meet market standards into rice flour that can be used in various food products.
- **Vermicelli Products**: Utilizing rice flour for the production of vermicelli, which has high demand in the market.
- **Animal Feed**: Using rice bran and rice bran from rice milling as quality animal feed ingredients.
- **Husk Charcoal Briquettes**: Utilizing rice husks, which are usually waste, as raw materials for the production of charcoal briquettes, which can be used as alternative fuel.

3. **Consistent Quality Management**
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)**: Develop and implement strict SOPs to ensure that every milling process runs according to standards.
- **Quality Control**: Conduct routine quality control to ensure that the quality of rice and by-products produced is in accordance with the established standards.

##### Added Value of Integrated Rice Milling

By implementing an integrated rice milling strategy, the added value generated can be significant. This added value ranges from IDR 6.4 million to IDR 16.6 million per hectare. Several factors that contribute to this added value include:
1. **Increased Efficiency**: The use of modern technology increases the efficiency of the milling process and reduces yield losses.
2. **High Rice Quality**: High-quality rice has a better selling price in the market.
3. **Product Diversification**: Processing by-products into various value-added products increases income.
4. **Waste Reduction**: Utilizing rice milling waste for the production of rice husk charcoal briquettes helps reduce waste and provides additional economic value.
