Understanding the importance of soil fertility is a crucial first step in designing a sustainable agricultural strategy. PT Matari Agro Indonesia, through its agricultural consulting and training services, places serious emphasis on the use of organic fertilizers as an environmentally friendly solution. With this approach, Matari Agro not only helps farmers improve their agricultural yields but also contributes positively to environmental sustainability.

Organic fertilizers offer a number of significant advantages over conventional chemical fertilizers, from providing more balanced nutrition for plants to improving soil structure and increasing soil microbial health. This is in line with Matari Agro's vision to empower farmers with the knowledge and skills needed to sustainably utilize natural resources.

In addition to providing consulting services to design appropriate fertilization programs, Matari Agro is also active in educating farmers about modern agricultural techniques that prioritize sustainability. Through structured training, farmers are given an in-depth understanding of the benefits of organic fertilizers, how to apply them effectively, and the importance of managing land sustainably to support long-term productivity. Thus, Matari Agro is not only an agricultural service provider but also a partner committed to helping farmers achieve success in their agricultural efforts while maintaining the balance of the ecosystem.

Soil fertility is a major factor in agricultural success that needs to be taken seriously. The use of environmentally friendly organic fertilizers is the main choice in maintaining environmental sustainability and improving the quality of agricultural products. This article will review in depth three types of organic fertilizers that are effective in increasing soil fertility:

##### 1. Manure

Manure is one of the most common types of organic fertilizers used in organic farming. This fertilizer is produced from the waste of livestock such as cows, goats, or chickens. Animal waste contains important nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which are essential for plant growth. In addition, the use of manure also helps improve soil structure and increases the water storage capacity of the soil. By utilizing manure, farmers not only increase their harvest yields but also reduce the negative impacts of animal waste.

##### 2. Compost

Compost is the result of the composting process of organic materials such as leaves, straw, plant residues, and other organic materials. This composting process involves the decomposition of microorganisms that break down organic materials into simpler materials that are easily absorbed by plants. Compost is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and contains microbes that are beneficial to the soil. The use of compost not only increases soil fertility but also helps reduce organic waste that is disposed of, making it an environmentally friendly choice.

##### 3. Biofertilizer

Biofertilizer or biofertilizer is an organic fertilizer that contains living microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms help in increasing soil fertility by improving soil structure, increasing the availability of nutrients for plants, and breaking down organic matter into simpler materials. In addition, biofertilizers also help increase plant resistance to environmental stress and disease, thereby increasing overall agricultural productivity.

By utilizing types of organic fertilizers such as manure, compost, and biofertilizers, farmers can increase soil fertility naturally and sustainably. PT Matari Agro Indonesia supports the use of environmentally friendly agricultural technology and practices through integrated agricultural consulting services and training centers, so that every farmer can achieve optimal agricultural results without damaging the surrounding environment.
