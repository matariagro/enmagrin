Hydroponic farming is increasingly popular in Indonesia, especially among farmers who have limited land. This system allows plants to be planted without using soil, but with special planting media and the right nutrient solution. PT Matari Agro Indonesia, as a provider of agricultural consulting services and training centers, is committed to providing a complete guide for you to successfully start hydroponic farming.

Hydroponics, derived from the Greek word for “water work,” uses mineral solutions in water instead of soil. This method offers many benefits such as higher water efficiency, better environmental control, and faster and more consistent results. For beginners, it is recommended to choose easy-to-grow plants such as lettuce, spinach, or kale, as these plants have a fast growth cycle and do not require complicated care.

There are several hydroponic systems to choose from, such as the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) which flows nutrient solution through pipes or gutters that accommodate plant roots, Deep Water Culture (DWC) where plant roots are submerged in nutrient solution, and Ebb and Flow (Flood and Drain) which periodically waters and drains the growing medium. The choice of growing medium is also important, with some popular choices being Rockwool which provides good support and high water retention, Hydroton (Clay Pebbles) with good aeration and can be reused, and Coco Coir which is environmentally friendly and made from coconut fiber.

Hydroponic nutrients must be complete and balanced, including the main elements such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well as other microelements. In addition, pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC) are important parameters that must be monitored regularly, with the optimal pH for most hydroponic plants ranging from 5.5 to 6.5. Lighting is also an important factor, especially if growing indoors, where grow lights with the appropriate spectrum can help the plant's photosynthesis process.

Watering in hydroponics must be regular and systematic, ensuring that the irrigation system is not clogged and that the nutrient solution is always available to the plants. Although hydroponics reduces the risk of pests and soil diseases, preventive measures such as good sanitation and regular monitoring for signs of attack are still needed. Sowing seeds is a crucial first step. Use a seedling tray and a suitable growing medium to sow the seeds until they are ready to be transferred to the hydroponic system.

Once the seeds have grown into strong enough seedlings, carefully transfer them to the hydroponic system so that the roots are not damaged. Temperature and humidity must be kept stable according to the specific needs of the plants, usually the ideal temperature ranges between 20-25°C. Pruning and thinning are needed to ensure that the plants grow optimally and do not compete for nutrients. Harvesting is carried out according to the age of the plants and signs of ripeness, and after harvesting, carry out post-harvest handling properly so that the results remain fresh and of high quality.

Management of resources such as water, nutrients, and energy must be efficient to maintain the sustainability of the hydroponic business. PT Matari Agro Indonesia has successfully implemented a hydroponic system for various types of plants, producing high-quality products with optimal efficiency. PT Matari Agro Indonesia also provides training and consulting services for anyone interested in starting hydroponics, whether individuals, agricultural companies, or local governments.

Hydroponics is very suitable for application in urban areas, where agricultural land is limited. Rooftop farming and vertical farming are increasingly popular solutions. Support from the government and supportive policies are very important for developing hydroponics in Indonesia, and PT Matari Agro Indonesia actively participates in various government programs to advance hydroponic farming.

Technology continues to advance, and innovations such as IoT sensors and system automation are making it easier to manage hydroponic farming. Hydroponics has great potential to boost local economies and provide sustainable farming solutions, and PT Matari Agro Indonesia is committed to contributing to the welfare of society through this technology.

For beginners, start small and learn each step thoroughly. Don't hesitate to seek guidance and support from experts. Like any other farming method, hydroponics also has its challenges, such as proper nutrient management and pest control, but with the right knowledge and technology, these challenges can be overcome. The potential for hydroponics in Indonesia is huge, and with a supportive climate and increasing interest, the future of hydroponics in Indonesia is very bright.

Hydroponic farming offers many benefits and great potential, both for individuals, agricultural companies, and local governments. With guidance and support from PT Matari Agro Indonesia, you can start and succeed in your hydroponic farming business. Start small, learn each step, and utilize the technology and resources available to achieve optimal results.
