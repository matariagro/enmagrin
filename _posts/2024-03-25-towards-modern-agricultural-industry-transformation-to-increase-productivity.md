#### Agricultural Modernization to Increase Scale of Production

Indonesian agriculture is entering an era of transformation that presents great opportunities to increase the scale of production and efficiency. One of the main keys to achieving this is by implementing modern technology in all aspects of agriculture. From the use of drones for land monitoring to automated irrigation systems that are tailored to the needs of crops, technology is opening the door to more efficient and productive agriculture.

Not only that, modernization also presents a new approach to agricultural business management. The use of sophisticated farm management software allows farmers to track inventory, monitor crop conditions, and plan crops more efficiently. This all helps to increase productivity, reduce waste, and increase profits for farmers.

#### Holistic Approach in Sustainable Agricultural Modernization

However, agricultural modernization is not only about technology. The importance of paying attention to economic, social, and environmental aspects is also a major focus in moving towards modern and sustainable Indonesian agriculture. This holistic approach places the balance between economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability as top priorities.

In the context of agricultural modernization, this means paying attention to land sustainability, wise use of natural resources, and farmer welfare. For example, encouraging sustainable agricultural practices such as the use of organic fertilizers, integrated pest control techniques, and efficient fertilization are important steps in ensuring that agricultural modernization goes hand in hand with environmental sustainability.
