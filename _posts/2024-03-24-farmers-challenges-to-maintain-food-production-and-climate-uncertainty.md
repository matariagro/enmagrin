In the face of rapid global climate change, rice farmers in Indonesia face challenges to maintain food production. Extreme weather events such as heavy rains, floods and droughts threaten crop yields. Coupled with a lack of innovation and technology adoption, farmers' livelihoods are deteriorating.

Unpredictable climate change disrupts agricultural cycles, especially rice cultivation. Extreme rainfall causes flooding and damages crops, while extreme droughts dry out land and damage crops. Farmers who rely on traditional seasonal patterns are highly vulnerable to unpredictable weather fluctuations.

Extreme rains and floods, such as those that occurred this season, have resulted in rice crop failures. Examples are Demak, Kendal, Semarang and Patti districts in Central Java. During the harvest season, the rice plants were submerged in floodwaters. When the floodwaters began to recede, farmers began preparing to plant the rice again, but after sowing the seeds, heavy rains came for three days and caused flooding. There is no doubt that farmers will suffer losses again due to this incident.

Farmers across Indonesia often face water shortages when the planting season begins. Due to reduced rainfall and changing seasonal patterns, the amount of water available for irrigation is limited. On the other hand, limited access to irrigation technology makes it difficult for farmers to use water efficiently, especially in marginal areas.

In addition, rice maintenance is also a challenge. The high price of fertilizers and pest control products makes it difficult for farmers to adequately care for their crops. Many farmers are forced to reduce the use of fertilizers and chemicals, resulting in lower productivity and crop quality.

As the harvest season approaches, farmers often face low rice prices. Despite their best efforts to plant and care for the crops, the price of rice crops is often determined by unstable market mechanisms. Farmers often fall victim to middlemen and mafia who take advantage of this situation to buy rice at low prices.

Most rice farmers in Indonesia sell all their rice at harvest time. This is because harvesting is a solution to ease the burden on households. The harvest season is the only hope for farmers to be free from various debts including purchase debts, living expenses debts and other financial difficulties.

This situation is exacerbated by the lack of government protection and support. Reductions in fertilizer subsidies and the lack of price protection programs further corner farmers. In addition, the average age of Indonesian farmers is already over 50 years old, which is a barrier to adopting new technologies to address climate change.

To overcome these challenges and find sustainable solutions, a joint effort is needed between the government, research institutions, local communities and farmers. Support in the form of proactive policies, farmer training and education, and promotion of technological innovation are key to increasing the resilience of Indonesian rice farmers in the face of unpredictable climate change.
