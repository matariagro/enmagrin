##### Selection of Superior Seeds
Seeds are a key factor that affects the potential yield of rice. Selecting superior seeds that are suitable for environmental conditions and soil types is very important. Superior seeds have good adaptation properties to certain environmental factors and are able to produce more productive plants.

##### Jajar Legowo Planting System
Jajar legowo planting is a planting technique that regulates planting distances and planting patterns in a certain way to increase land use and nutrient absorption. By using this system, rice plants can grow healthier and stronger, producing more rice shoots and grains per unit of land.

##### Balanced Fertilization
Proper and balanced fertilization is very important in improving the quality and quantity of rice harvests. Using organic and inorganic fertilizers proportionally, according to the needs of the plants at each phase of their growth, can ensure that the rice plants get all the nutrients needed to grow optimally.

##### Integrated Pest and Disease Control
Pests and diseases are often a serious threat to rice production. By implementing an integrated approach, such as the use of disease-resistant varieties, crop rotation, and the use of biological control agents, farmers can reduce the risk of losses due to pests and diseases.

##### Timely Harvesting
Harvesting rice at the right time is essential to maximize yields. Harvesting too early can reduce yield potential, while harvesting too late can increase the risk of losses due to bad weather or pests.

##### Case Studies of Successful Modern Cultivation Techniques
The application of modern cultivation techniques has resulted in success in increasing rice yields in various regions. Examples of the use of superior seeds, the jajar legowo planting system, balanced fertilization, and integrated pest control can inspire other farmers to adopt similar practices.
