Agriculture is an important sector in the Indonesian economy, and rice is one of the main commodities relied upon by millions of farmers. However, the plunge in grain prices in recent weeks has caused panic among farmers. In various regions, grain prices have fallen significantly, making it difficult for farmers to cover production costs and earn decent profits. This condition raises concerns about the future of rice farming in Indonesia and the sustainability of small farmers' livelihoods.

##### Impact of Declining Paddy Prices on Farmers

The decline in paddy prices has a direct impact on farmers' welfare. Production costs, including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor, are not comparable to the low selling price of paddy. As a result, many farmers suffer losses and face difficulties in meeting their daily needs. Some are even forced to go into debt to continue the next planting season. This situation creates a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break, especially for small farmers who do not have access to adequate capital or financial assistance.

Furthermore, the decline in paddy prices has also impacted farmers' motivation to continue planting rice. Many are starting to consider switching to other commodities or even abandoning farming altogether. If this trend continues, national rice production could be threatened, which will ultimately affect Indonesia's food security. Therefore, it is important to find effective solutions to overcome this problem and ensure the sustainability of the rice farming sector.

##### Potential Solutions to Overcome the Decline in Paddy Prices

To overcome the decline in paddy prices and support farmers, a comprehensive and integrated approach is needed. Here are some solutions that can be considered:

1. **Government Intervention:** The government can intervene in the market by purchasing paddy from farmers at a fair price through Bulog or related institutions. This will help stabilize paddy prices and provide income security for farmers.

2. **Diversification of Agricultural Products:** Reducing dependence on rice by developing diversification of agricultural products can be a long-term solution. Farmers can be encouraged to plant other commodities that have high economic value and stable market demand.

3. **Post-Harvest Technology Development:** Improving post-harvest technology, such as modern rice milling and good storage, can help increase the added value of rice products. Derivative products such as rice flour, bran, and husks can be used as additional sources of income for farmers.

4. **Access to Finance and Insurance:** Expanding farmers' access to affordable finance and agricultural insurance can help them overcome financial risks and stabilize incomes. Agricultural credit programs with low or no interest can be very helpful.

5. **Agricultural Training and Extension:** PT Matari Agro Indonesia, as an integrated agricultural training and consulting service center, can play an important role in providing training and extension to farmers. Training on efficient cultivation techniques, financial management, and agricultural product marketing can improve farmers' capacity to face market challenges.

6. **Strengthening Farmer Cooperatives:** Farmer cooperatives can be a means to increase farmers' bargaining power in the market. Through cooperatives, farmers can sell grain collectively, reduce production costs through bulk purchasing of input materials, and gain better access to markets.
