This article will outline the detailed steps to extend the life of celery using the polybag method, from preparing the planting medium to ongoing maintenance.

##### 1. Preparing the Planting Media

The first step is to prepare the appropriate planting media. Use a polybag and fill it with enough soil, just to cover the celery root stems. Avoid filling the polybag full at the beginning of planting. The planting media must be fertile and loose to support optimal growth.

##### 2. Initial Planting

Plant the celery seeds in a polybag that has been filled with enough soil. Make sure the root stems are well covered. This process allows the celery roots to develop without pressure from excessive soil media.

##### 3. Maintenance and Harvesting

After the celery has been harvested 2-3 times, add soil or organic compost to the polybag. Add little by little until the polybag is full. This technique ensures that the celery gets enough nutrients continuously, because the new soil media provides the necessary nutrients.

##### 4. Adding Soil

Add soil or compost periodically after every few harvests. This process must be done gradually to ensure that the celery roots can continue to grow well and get enough nutrients. Make sure to fold the polybag first before adding soil for easy management.

##### 5. Filling the Polybag until Full

Continue the process of adding soil or compost until the polybag is full. This step not only extends the life of the plant but also improves the quality and quantity of the celery harvest.

##### 6. Removing and Replanting

Once the polybag is full, remove the celery tubers and cut the necessary parts. Then, replant the celery in a new planting medium to start a new growth cycle. In this way, you can extend the life of the celery plant up to four years or more.

With the right polybag method, you can extend the life of the celery plant up to 4 years. PT Matari Agro Indonesia supports sustainable agricultural practices by providing comprehensive guidance and training. This method not only increases production efficiency but also ensures that plants get optimal nutrition. Good luck and hopefully useful!
