Tungro disease in rice is one of the main threats to rice farming in Indonesia. This disease is caused by two types of viruses transmitted by green planthoppers, which can cause a drastic decrease in yields and even crop failure. The impact of tungro disease is not only economically detrimental but also threatens national food security. This article is here to provide a complete and practical guide for farmers in dealing with tungro disease, from recognizing early symptoms, effective prevention strategies, to reliable control methods.

Overcoming tungro disease requires a holistic and integrated approach. Starting from selecting rice varieties that are resistant to tungro, good land management, to setting the right planting time. In addition, controlling the main vector of this disease, namely green leafhoppers, is the main focus of the control strategy. The use of appropriate insecticides, biological control with natural enemies, and the application of modern technology such as drones and pest monitoring sensors all play an important role in maintaining the health of rice plants.

PT Matari Agro Indonesia plays an active role in supporting farmers with various training and extension programs that focus on controlling tungro disease. As a provider of integrated agricultural consulting services and training centers, PT Matari Agro Indonesia provides the latest knowledge and technology to help farmers manage their land more effectively and sustainably. With this comprehensive approach, it is hoped that farmers can increase productivity and maintain national food security.

Support from the government is also very important in facing this challenge. Policies such as subsidies for tungro-resistant seeds, integrated pest control (IPM) programs, and agricultural insurance are some of the steps taken by the government to help farmers. With synergy between farmers, PT Matari Agro Indonesia, and the government, the challenge of tungro disease can be overcome, and national food security can be maintained properly. This article will explain more about the strategies and concrete steps that can be taken to overcome tungro disease in rice.

##### Recognizing Tungro Disease Symptoms

Tungro disease is usually characterized by a change in leaf color to yellow or reddish orange, especially at the top. In addition, plant growth is inhibited, panicles do not develop properly, and seeds produced are reduced. Affected leaves also tend to curl and dry out. Plants infected in the early stages of growth are more susceptible to severe damage than those infected in the later stages.

##### Tungro Disease Prevention Strategy

1. **Selection of Tungro-Resistant Varieties:** One effective step in preventing tungro disease is to plant rice varieties that are resistant to this disease. Tungro-resistant varieties can reduce the risk of infection and help farmers maintain land productivity.

2. **Good Land Management:** Clearing the land of crop residues and weeds that can be hosts for green leafhoppers. Crop rotation is also recommended to break the life cycle of pests and pathogens.

3. **Planting Time:** Planting rice at the right time can reduce the population of green leafhoppers. Simultaneous planting in one area also helps reduce the risk of disease spread.

##### Tungro Disease Control Methods

1. **Green Leafhopper Control:** Since green leafhoppers are the main vectors of the spread of tungro virus, their control is the main key in disease control strategies. The use of appropriate insecticides and biological control with natural enemies of green leafhoppers can be applied.

2. **Use of Biocontrol Agents:** The use of biocontrol agents such as entomopathogenic fungi and parasitoids can help control green leafhopper populations naturally, without damaging the ecosystem.

3. **Application of Modern Technology:** Technologies such as sensor-based pest monitoring and the use of drones for insecticide spraying can help farmers manage their land more efficiently and precisely.

##### Government Policy in Supporting Tungro Disease Control

The Indonesian government has issued various policies to support farmers in overcoming tungro disease. Subsidies for tungro-resistant seeds, integrated pest control (IPM) programs, and technical assistance and extension are some of the forms of support provided. In addition, agricultural insurance programs are also expected to provide financial protection for farmers who experience losses due to disease attacks.
