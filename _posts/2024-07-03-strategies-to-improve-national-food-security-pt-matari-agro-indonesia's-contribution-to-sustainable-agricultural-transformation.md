National food security is not only about securing food supplies for the entire population, but also becomes the main foundation in maintaining economic stability and social welfare in Indonesia. This article illustrates the importance of implementing innovative strategies in supporting food security, with a focus on the crucial role of PT Matari Agro Indonesia in advancing sustainable agriculture. The company not only provides technical consultation to farmers, but also trains them in modern sustainable practices, such as the use of organic fertilizers and efficient irrigation technology. In this way, PT Matari Agro Indonesia plays a key role in the shift towards more productive agriculture that is resilient to climate change and other global challenges.

In addition to increasing food production, the strategy to improve national food security also includes a significant reduction in post-harvest losses. PT Matari Agro Indonesia provides solutions by educating farmers on effective post-harvest handling practices, such as the use of modern storage technology and proper packaging systems. By reducing post-harvest losses, not only can the amount of food available be maintained, but also its quality can be improved, supporting the overall goal of strengthening national food security.

In the context of ongoing globalization and climate change, food diversification is becoming an increasingly important strategy to secure national food security. PT Matari Agro Indonesia supports farmers in adopting multifunctional agriculture, by developing a variety of food crops and horticulture that are appropriate to local conditions and market needs. Diversification not only reduces dependence on a single type of crop, but also strengthens the economic resilience of farmers and rural communities as a whole. Through these steps, PT Matari Agro Indonesia is committed to continuing to play a role in realizing sustainable and inclusive national food security for all Indonesian people.

##### Increasing Food Production
One of the main strategies to increase national food security is to increase overall food production. PT Matari Agro Indonesia plays a role in providing consultation to farmers on modern cultivation techniques, the use of organic fertilizers, and efficient water resource management. With this approach, the company not only increases crop productivity but also optimizes the use of agricultural land to achieve greater yields.

##### Reducing Post-Harvest Losses
Post-harvest losses, such as drying and yield loss, are serious challenges in efforts to increase food security. PT Matari Agro Indonesia provides training on effective post-harvest handling techniques, including the use of modern storage technology and proper packaging practices. By reducing post-harvest losses, the potential for national food production can be significantly increased.

##### Food Diversification
Food diversification is also a key strategy in increasing food security. PT Matari Agro Indonesia encourages farmers to develop multifunctional agriculture that produces various types of food crops and horticulture. Through a comprehensive training program, the company helps farmers select and manage crop varieties that are appropriate to local conditions and market demand. Food diversification not only improves national food security but also strengthens farmers' economic resilience.
