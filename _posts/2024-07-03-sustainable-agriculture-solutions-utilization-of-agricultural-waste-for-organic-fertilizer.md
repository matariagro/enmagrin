Utilizing agricultural waste to produce organic fertilizer not only reduces the amount of unused waste but also supports sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. This process involves a series of steps starting from collecting agricultural waste such as straw, compost from harvest residues, and greens, to processing through controlled fermentation and decomposition techniques. PT Matari Agro Indonesia plays a key role in educating farmers on these modern techniques, providing guidance in selecting the right raw materials and optimal processing processes to produce high-quality organic fertilizer.

Organic fertilizer produced from agricultural waste has significant benefits in increasing soil fertility. As a natural nutrient source, organic fertilizer not only provides essential nutrients for plants but also improves soil structure and water retention. Compared to chemical fertilizers, the use of organic fertilizers reduces the risk of environmental pollution and supports the sustainability of the agricultural environment. PT Matari Agro Indonesia actively promotes the application of organic fertilizers as part of sustainable agricultural practices, helping farmers to increase their crop productivity sustainably and reduce dependence on chemical inputs.

##### Processing of Agricultural Waste into Organic Fertilizer
The first step in processing agricultural waste is selecting the type of waste that is suitable to be used as raw material for organic fertilizer. Waste such as straw, harvest compost, and green waste can be processed through a controlled decomposition process. PT Matari Agro applies the right compost and fermentation methods to convert this waste into organic fertilizer that is rich in nutrients and beneficial soil microorganisms.

##### Benefits of Organic Fertilizer and Its Use
Organic fertilizer produced from agricultural waste has various benefits, including improving soil structure, increasing water retention, and providing balanced nutrition for plants.
