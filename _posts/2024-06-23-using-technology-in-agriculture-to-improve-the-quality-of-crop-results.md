In recent years, agriculture has experienced very rapid development, especially with technological innovation and changes in people's lifestyles. In this article, we will discuss how technology can be used to improve the quality of crops, such as by using hydroponic and greenhouse systems.

##### Use of Hydroponic Systems

The hydroponic system is a plant cultivation technique that uses water enriched with nutrients as a planting medium. This technique is very suitable for those of you who want to start a farming business, but have limited land. The advantage of hydroponic farming compared to conventional farming lies in the easier maintenance and cultivation of plants. You need to know that hydroponics uses a planting medium that is clean from dirt, so that it produces quality plants with high selling prices.

##### Use of Green Houses

A greenhouse is a structure used to utilize sunlight and regulate temperature and humidity to improve plant conditions. Green houses are very effective in increasing crop yields, especially for plants that require specific temperatures and humidity.
