Planting shallots (*Allium cepa var. aggregatum*) in polybags is not only possible for those with limited land, but is also an innovative step in gardening in the home environment. PT Matari Agro Indonesia presents solutions through its agricultural consulting and training services, which are designed to help garden people achieve success in growing shallots. With this comprehensive guide, you will be guided from proper seed preparation to the care and harvesting process, ensuring that every stage goes well to produce high-quality shallots.

The first step that must be taken is to prepare superior quality shallot seeds. PT Matari Agro Indonesia emphasizes the importance of choosing healthy and fresh seeds, with smooth skin and free from black spots. After that, the right planting medium is also the main focus, where a mixture of soil, compost, and rice husk charcoal is recommended to create a fertile environment for the growth of shallots in polybags.

The correct planting process is the key to success in cultivating shallots in polybags. PT Matari Agro Indonesia recommends planting at the right depth and sufficient distance between the seeds, as well as routine care such as watering and fertilizing to support optimal plant growth. With guidance and support from PT Matari Agro Indonesia, garden people can carry out gardening activities more effectively and make maximum use of limited space in their home environment.

##### 1. Preparing Quality Seeds

The first step in planting shallots is to prepare good quality seeds. Choose seeds that are round, have smooth skin, and do not contain black spots. Cut the tip of the shallot about 1/3 to stimulate shoot growth. It is important to cut the tip where the roots will grow, not the roots themselves. Prepare the seeds carefully before planting to ensure the plants have a good start.

##### 2. Preparing the Planting Media

Prepare the planting media with a mixture of soil, compost, and rice husk charcoal in a ratio of 1:1:1. Mix the mixture thoroughly and put it in the prepared polybag. Make sure the polybag has a minimum size of 30 cm x 30 cm or 50 cm x 50 cm. Fill the polybag up to 80% with the planting media, then water it with enough water. Leave it for 1-2 days so that the ingredients are absorbed properly before planting the shallot seeds. Make a water channel in the polybag to prevent waterlogging that can damage the seeds.

##### 3. The Right Planting Process

Plant 5-6 shallot seeds in a polybag that has been filled with planting media. Make sure the cut part of the onion is facing up and provide a distance of about 8-10 cm between one seedling and another. Plant the seeds at a depth of about 6-7 cm to ensure optimal growth. Pay attention to the planting distance to provide enough space for each shallot plant to grow well. Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil after planting.

##### 4. Maximum Care

Water regularly, twice a day in the morning and evening, with enough water to maintain soil moisture. Shallots need enough sunlight, so place the polybag in a location that gets direct sunlight or enough light. Clean weeds regularly to prevent competition for nutrients and growing space with shallots. Provide liquid fertilizer regularly once a week for the first six months after planting to accelerate growth.

##### 5. The Right Harvest Time

Shallots are ready to be harvested after about 3 months. The sign is that the leaves begin to turn yellow and the stem feels empty when pressed with the bulbs rising to the surface. The color of the bulbs will also turn red when fully ripe. Harvest the shallots by picking the bulbs carefully to avoid damaging the plants. After harvesting, dry the shallots in a dry and bright place before storing to maintain their quality and shelf life.
