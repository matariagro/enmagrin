Climate change has become an inevitable global issue, affecting various sectors, including agriculture. In Indonesia, this sector is the backbone of the economy that is highly dependent on weather and climate conditions. Facing this phenomenon, PT Matari Agro Indonesia is committed to supporting the agricultural sector through adaptive and innovative consulting and training services.

Climate change causes an increase in global average temperatures which has a direct impact on crop production. Higher temperatures accelerate evapotranspiration, increase crop water needs, and shorten the life cycle of some crops. Changing rainfall patterns also result in prolonged droughts or floods, which damage agricultural land and reduce productivity. Farmers rely on a stable planting calendar to ensure optimal harvests. However, climate change is making seasonal patterns more erratic. This uncertainty complicates planting and harvest planning and increases the risk of crop failure.

Warmer temperatures allow some types of pests and plant diseases to develop more quickly and spread to previously unaffected areas. This forces farmers to increase pesticide use, which in turn can damage ecosystems and human health. Soil erosion and land degradation are exacerbated by extreme rainfall and improper land management. Less fertile soils reduce crop yields and require more efforts to restore, such as more fertilizer use and more sophisticated soil conservation techniques. Crop failures and reduced agricultural productivity impact farmer incomes and rural economic stability. Income uncertainty can also lead to population migration to urban areas, adding pressure on urban infrastructure.

To address these challenges, PT Matari Agro Indonesia offers adaptation solutions through consulting and training services. Developing and introducing crop varieties that are resistant to extreme conditions such as drought, flooding, and high temperatures is an important step. PT Matari Agro Indonesia works with research institutions to introduce these superior varieties to farmers. Efficient irrigation helps optimize water use, especially in drought-prone areas. Automatically controlled drip and sprinkler irrigation systems can save water and increase crop yields.

Training in soil conservation techniques such as terracing, composting, and the use of organic mulch can help maintain soil fertility and prevent erosion. Good water management through rainwater harvesting and integrated irrigation systems is also important for agricultural resilience. Planting various types of crops in one area (polyculture) can reduce the risk of losses due to extreme weather. Crop diversification also increases biodiversity and ecosystem health. Through training programs, PT Matari Agro Indonesia educates farmers about modern agricultural techniques and climate adaptation. This training includes the use of agricultural technology, risk management, and sustainable agricultural practices.

The use of information technology to provide accurate weather and climate data and early warning systems helps farmers prepare for changing weather conditions. PT Matari Agro Indonesia provides a digital platform to disseminate this information quickly and accurately. Collaboration with local governments and international institutions allows for broader and more coordinated implementation of adaptation programs. Policy and funding support from governments and international organizations are critical to the success of adaptation programs.

Climate change poses serious challenges to the agricultural sector in Indonesia. However, with an innovative and collaborative adaptive approach, these challenges can be overcome. PT Matari Agro Indonesia is dedicated to supporting farmers, agricultural companies, and local governments through research and technology-based consulting and training services. Effective adaptation measures will not only improve the resilience of agriculture to climate change but also ensure the sustainability of the agricultural sector for future generations.
