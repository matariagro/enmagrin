Here are some effective organic farming techniques implemented at PT. Matari Agro Indonesia, which have proven to produce successful results:

##### Organic Soil Management
One of the keys to success in organic farming is good soil management. PT. Matari Agro implements practices such as proper soil composition, use of organic fertilizers such as compost and manure, and planting cover crops to maintain soil moisture and structure. This helps to naturally increase soil fertility and reduce dependence on synthetic chemicals.

##### Organic Pest and Disease Control
PT. Matari Agro prioritizes an environmentally friendly approach to pest and disease control. They use biological methods such as predatory insect rearing, crop rotation, and the use of organic products that have proven effective in controlling pests and plant diseases without damaging the environment or leaving harmful residues on plants.

##### Crop Rotation and Polyculture Practices
Crop rotation and polyculture practices are also a major focus in organic farming at PT. Matari Agro. Crop rotation helps reduce the risk of disease and increase soil fertility by introducing different types of crops alternately. Meanwhile, polyculture or planting different types of crops in one area helps to improve ecosystem balance and maximize the use of land and water resources.

##### Efficient Irrigation and Water Management
Efficient water management is essential in organic farming. PT. Matari Agro uses techniques such as drip irrigation or well-programmed irrigation systems to optimize water usage without wastage. This not only helps in maintaining proper soil moisture but also reduces the risk of erosion and pollution of water resources.

By implementing effective organic farming techniques such as organic soil management, environmentally friendly pest and disease control, crop rotation and polyculture, and efficient water management, PT. Matari Agro has succeeded in creating a sustainable and productive organic farming model. These practices not only provide high-quality yields but also maintain the balance of the ecosystem and support the company's vision of supporting organic farming in Indonesia.
