Agriculture has been the backbone of the Indonesian economy for centuries. However, in this modern era, the challenges faced by farmers are increasingly complex. To meet the increasing needs of society, while facing climate change and economic pressures, a new approach is needed. This is where the concept of downstreaming agriculture becomes increasingly important, and Matari Agro Indonesia has led this movement with its holistic approach.

The first stage in the downstreaming process is organizing farmers and farmer groups. Matari Agro Indonesia acts as a catalyst in gathering small farmers and uniting them into a larger entity. Through cooperation and support, farmers can work together to achieve higher efficiency in agricultural production.

Once farmers are organized, the next step is to build farmer corporations. In this context, Matari Agro Indonesia plays a role in assisting farmers in building efficient and sustainable corporate structures. By combining resources and knowledge, farmer corporations can become a powerful force in the agricultural industry, enabling them to compete in an increasingly competitive global market.

Innovation in the production process is the main key in agricultural downstreaming. Matari Agro Indonesia continues to encourage the use of modern technology and sustainable agricultural practices in food crop cultivation. For example, in rice production, they introduce the provision of superior seeds that are more resistant to disease and extreme weather, and apply mechanization to increase efficiency in planting and maintaining plants.

Not only that, controlling OPT (Plant Pest Organisms) is also a main focus in the agricultural downstreaming process. Matari Agro Indonesia uses an integrated approach in controlling pests and plant diseases, reducing dependence on chemical pesticides that are harmful to the environment and human health.

Furthermore, in the harvest and post-harvest handling stages, Matari Agro Indonesia provides training and guidance to farmers on best practices in storing, packaging, and managing harvests. This aims to ensure that the quality of agricultural products is maintained from the fields to the consumer's table.

The end result of the agricultural downstreaming process is high-quality agricultural products that are ready to be sold to the market. For example, rice produced through the agricultural downstreaming process has better quality, is cleaner from dirt and pesticide residues, and has a longer shelf life.

With a holistic and sustainable approach, Matari Agro Indonesia paves the way for Indonesian farmers to increase the added value of their agricultural products, enter wider markets, and improve their welfare. They not only provide instant solutions, but also invest in long-term changes that will have a positive impact on the Indonesian agricultural industry.
