<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/{{ page.image }}" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="img-fluid rounded img-content-right">
#### Challenges in Modern Agriculture

Amidst the challenges faced by modern farmers, controlling plant pests and diseases is one of the most vital aspects in maintaining productivity and quality of the harvest. Plants infected with disease or attacked by pests can result in huge losses for farmers, both in terms of quantity and quality of the harvest. Therefore, it is important to have an effective and holistic control strategy.

#### Organic and Conventional Approaches

In an effort to control plant pests and diseases, there are two main approaches that can be applied, namely organic and conventional methods. Organic methods emphasize the use of natural and environmentally friendly materials, such as compost, botanical insecticides, and microorganisms that are beneficial to plants. Meanwhile, conventional methods include the use of chemical pesticides and other technologies to eradicate pests and diseases.
