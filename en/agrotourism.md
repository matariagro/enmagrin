#### Introducing Agrotourism

Agrotourism is a form of tourism related to agricultural activities. More than just a vacation, agrotourism provides a unique experience for visitors to explore the natural beauty of the countryside, learn about the agricultural process, and interact directly with local farmers. In addition to providing an interesting experience for tourists, agrotourism development also has great potential to increase farmer incomes and promote public awareness of the importance of sustainable agriculture.

#### Potential of Agrotourism in Increasing Farmers' Income

Agrotourism development not only provides benefits for tourists, but also has a positive impact on farmers and local communities. By opening their gardens or fields to be visited by tourists, farmers have the opportunity to diversify their sources of income. They can sell agricultural products directly to visitors, hold garden or field tours, or organize other activities such as joint harvesting or fruit picking. This additional income can help improve farmers' economic welfare and increase the sustainability of their agricultural businesses.

#### Raising Awareness of Sustainable Agriculture

In addition to being a source of additional income for farmers, agrotourism development also plays an important role in raising public awareness of the importance of sustainable agriculture. Through direct experience in the garden or field, visitors can learn about environmentally friendly agricultural practices, the use of innovative agricultural technology, and the importance of maintaining the balance of the agricultural ecosystem. Thus, agrotourism not only provides entertainment, but also becomes an effective educational tool in building awareness of agricultural and environmental issues.
